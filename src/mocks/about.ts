    <p>The idea of DecorativeProgressive is based on our long-time interest in authentic,
    niche cultural objects found in faraway lands of Caucasus mountains. Our primary interest
    lays in fascinating designs of so-called Kaitag textiles made by Dargin people living in
    the Central Daghestan. Following the intricately embroidered patterns, the eye travels
    through opulent designs of Ottoman Velvet Yastiks and courtly Safavid Silk brocades transformed
    in an artistic, contemporary way along with archaic local designs. This gives us a source of
    endless inspiration to create our own objects. We continue the traditions of creating uniquely
    designed pieces through combining elements belonging to different cultures.</p>
    <p>We hope you will appreciate the layered aesthetics of our wall decor objects - silk embroidered
    panels, prints, paintings, and much more applied with innovative approach and high-quality craftsmanship.</p>
    <p>And there is more to come â€“ unique antique homeware, decorative objects and adornments, belonging to the
    rich cultures of the people of Caucasus, will be available on our website soon.</p>
    <p>DecorativeProgressive was founded in 2019 by Gohar, Eugene, and our daughter, Nika.
    We all see things differently and this is what helps us to see objects from various angles.</p>
